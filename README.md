Text-to-Speech Application 🔊
Overview 📝
This is a simple Text-to-Speech application built using Python and the Streamlit library. It allows users to enter text, select a voice (male or female), and adjust the speech speed using a slider.

Additionally, the application provides a download button to save the generated speech as an MP3 file.
