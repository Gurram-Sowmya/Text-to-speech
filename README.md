# Text-to-Speech Application 🔊

## Overview 📝

This is a simple Text-to-Speech application built using Python and the Streamlit library. It allows users to enter text, select a voice (male or female), and adjust the speech speed using a slider. The application then converts the entered text into speech, which the user can listen to using the integrated audio player. Additionally, the application provides a download button to save the generated speech as an MP3 file.
